Here is a collection of small tips for Lisp newcomers.

Wanted to recompile all places where Lisp macro was expanded?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Here is how to do it:

* On a macro name, hit ``C-c C-w m <ENTER>`` (this calls function ``slime-who-macroexpands``)
* Then Emacs will show a buffer with all places where this macro was expanded.
* Now, hit ``C-c C-k`` to recompile all of them at once!


.. note:: If using SLY hit ``C-c C-w RET`` instead.
