CL-HAMCREST
-----------

It is implementation of `Hamcrest <http://hamcrest.org/>`_ idea in Common Lisp.

It simplifes unittests and make them more readable. Hamcrest uses idea of pattern-matching, to construct matchers from different pieces and to apply them to the data.

Works nicely with Fukamachi's `Prove <https://github.com/fukamachi/prove>`_ unittest framework, but could be extended to support other frameworks.

"Made with Lisp" SVG version
----------------------------

SVG version of the great "Made with Lisp" logo by Manfred Spiller:

.. image:: /img/made-with-lisp.svg
   :alt: Made with Lisp
   :target: http://40ants.com/img/made-with-lisp.svg

It scales nicely and could be used in site's footer. For example, look at our's footer.
