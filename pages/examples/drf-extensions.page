master
------

Don't mangle @list_route anymore with extended router.  but does this make sense if the mixin for actions is going away?

this also breaks badly under 2.3.x and some tests still need to be rewritten.

reimplement_nested_routes_v1
----------------------------

Cleanup and fix router tests for django 1.8 & 1.9

Following command doesn't show failures:
 tox -e django.1.9,django.1.8.lts -- \
   tests_app.tests.unit.routers \
   tests_app.tests.functional.routers.

Reimplement nested routes moving lookups to viewsets

This change requires that parent viewset defines lookup_url_kwarg or
lookup_field. In exchange we do not need to define anything about url kwargs at
register phase.

Instead of defining in register argument how parent kwarg is used in filter,
we do that now in viewset.

Also there is NestedHyperlinkedRelatedField and NestedHyperlinkedIdentityField
which will use our data from viewsets to make writing serializers simpler and
less error prone.

You can also use register with with-statement.

reimplement_nested_routes

Reimplement nested routes and move lookup config to viewsets

This change requires that parent viewset defines lookup_url_kwarg or
lookup_field. In exchange we do not need to define anything about url kwargs at
register time. Old way is still supported, though pending deprecation.

Also there is NestedHyperlinkedRelatedField and NestedHyperlinkedIdentityField
which will use our config from viewsets to make writing serializers simpler and
less error prone.

You can also use register using with-statement.

ResourceUriField is identical to HyperlinkedIdentityField.

patch-1
-------

Pass response when rebuild_after_method_evaluation

I use the `updated_at` timestamp off of the instance in order to generate my object etags – for that I need to be able to retrieve the instance, which I current do by simply calling `view_instance.get_object()` – however, this will use the `lookup_field` and kwarg passed to filter the queryset.

Which is fine. Unless that field changed in an the request, e.g. it was an update.

Being able to grab the instance, or at the very least the response.data in the event that the etag is being calculated after method evaluation would be super handy for this use case.

Pass response from calculate_etag to etag_func.

Add a temporary fix failing queryset filters in nested routes

If a route such as /users/NOT_AN_INTEGER/settings would be
requested and the /users endpoint expects an integer as the second
part of the url then this request would throw a internal server error.

This is a temp fix and a proper solution should be found. Discussion
about this can be found on Github:
