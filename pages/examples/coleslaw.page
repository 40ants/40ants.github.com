Change asdf:load-system for ql:quickload.

libre-man/coleslaw
==================

custom_bindings
---------------

Make it possible to read metadata from multiple lines.

template-engine
---------------

Initial implementation of djula as templating engine

Backwards compatible with previous versions. You can specify a engine
in the config with the template-engine key.

Added some documentation for djula templates.

Added a hyde-djula theme and corrected a spelling mistake.

Hyde-djula is the same as hyde only made using djula and not closure.

Corrected the name for template-engine in the config.

Updated some documentation.

Refactored code to implement template engine as plugins.

Added templates for atom, rss and sitemap each template engine.

Updated source to add template engine to calls for rendering.

mordocai/coleslaw
=================

mordocai-net-head
-----------------

Add blog-index and site-index-page to config.

Move static files to be put directly in root.

This allows things like favicon.ico and robots.txt and similar.

However, it doesn't clean up old files so you will have to cleanup the
dist/staging dirs yourself.

Make blog page not the index and allow index conf

This is far from the best way to do this, but works for me for now.

Fix blog-index default.

New theme 'bootstrap'.

This theme is based on the 'readable' theme but using plain bootstrap 3.3.5
instead of readable.

It also adds support for the :img configuration in the sitenav that allows links
to be shown as images.

Applying the readable theme again now using bootstrap 3.

Making the templates polyglot HTML5.

The existing templates could not be served as XHTML as some tags weren't closed.
I also modified some markup to use more semantic tags from HTML5.

Adding a meta description to the generated HTML pages.

Add oni theme.

Allow relative URLs in the sitenav for oni.

Add viewport meta-tag.

Add center CSS class.

Fix font issue

Openfontlibrary isn't accessible through HTTPS, so webfont includes
weren't working.

Automatically overflow codeblocks

This looks much better on small screens.

Give unordered lists within articles some space

It is very hard to discern nested lists and regular paragraphs inside
lists opposed to multi-paragraph list items without it.

Readable theme should include links to prev/next page.

cmstrickland/coleslaw
=====================

add-post-types
--------------

Additional post metadata - type

Posts can have a 'type' attribute. I want my blog to have different
categories of posts, that are exactly like posts in all respects but are
styled differently ( linkblog entries, photo galleries etc. )
Adding this as metadata makes it easy to wrap posts in a container element to
attach styles to.

Temporary hack of hyde theme

integrate post types into index.

Subposts as a plugin (WIP)

Fixed repo-dir

changed repo-dir -> repo
use 'subpost as class key for writing indexes.

Minimum implementation of subclass for posts

hacky override of discover post method, still needs work.

Find-all matching adjusted

find-all implementation returns false positives for subclasses
added parameter of a predicate to implement matching, with a default
value that preserves original behaviour

added an exact class matcher to purge-all invocation of find-all to stop
it purging subclasses.

refactored incremental plugin process-change and documents purge-all
to use class-name-p when matching against exact class names.

------------

Bugfix: Feed should be an abstract class.

Remove scaffolded parallel plugin.

Tentatively factor deploy method into git-hook plugin. TODO follows...

* Deploy :after plugins probably need revision now, and coleslaw-heroku.
* README, HACKING need updates. Plugin-api.md too.
* NEWS needs a carefully worded entry.

Is that what we want?

Incremental compilation is done, note some new goals.

Add some error-handling notes.

More notes.

Some TODO notes.

Bugfixes.

Half-way commit to getting hardcoded paths out of templates.

Introduce custom bindings form for posts.

Use `bindings: name1 value1 ...` to bind special variables while
compiling a post.  Only a single bindings directive is supported in the
post metadata.

Fix order of forms.

PuercoPop/coleslaw
==================

coleslaw-conf-uiop
------------------

Simplify the setting of COLESLAW-CONF:*BASEDIR*

No need to use a before method specializing in the LOAD-OP. Use uiop's
pathname-parent-directory-pathname instead.

Improve COLESLAW-CONF:*BASEDIR* tests

Check for the presence of plugins and themes sub-directories.

limajs-take2
------------

First stab at plugins.

limajs
------

Make tags more palatable to the repl.

Better error reporting for theme errors

    This covers the case of when a theme doesn't have a specific
    template, say post.html and (theme-fn 'post) is called.

Current-directory not needed, use uiop instead

   Add setf expansion for getcwd.

More robust directory changing

     - Doesn't fail when the directory is missing a trailing '/'
     - When directory doesn't exist it signals an informative
       condition.

WIP towards LimaJS new web page.

First Working(ish) build.

patch-2
-------

Verify that parse-field returns an array.

Otherwise read-content fails to parse files with empty headers as it tries to aref nil.

twitter-summary-card
--------------------

Add twitter meta-data to posts

  This depends on a pending change to add-injection.

Bind content-text & add quotes to HTML attributes.

Add tests as a PoC. Do not for merge.

Foo.

Foo.

Finish theme, for now.

Fix article.

Make older/newer more visible.

user-defined-routing
--------------------

Update all page-url calls to only use the slug.

Hey, look! User-defined routes are easy. Slot-value is gross though.

Remove page-url methods now stored in the config.

We probably don't want to merge this in until users have had an
adjustment period or without putting a *big* warning in the NEWS.
Users will need to know to update their configs/steal the :routing
block from the example config.
