This is an experimental page. Here I'm embedding
[MGL-PAX](http://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax/) documentation builder
into a [Coleslaw](https://github.com/coleslaw-org/coleslaw)
static blog generator.

This is accomplished by adding a Coleslaw extension which defines
this method to render pages of \"mgl-pax\" type:
"

  (coleslaw::render-text (method nil (t (eql :mgl-pax))))

  "
By the way, the method documentation above was created using
MGL-PAX's *locative* inserted into this blog post's body:

```lisp
(coleslaw::render-text (method nil (t (eql :mgl-pax))))
```
"
