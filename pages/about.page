Who we are
==========

We are a group of Lisp hackers. Our goal is to extend Common Lisp's ecosystem
and to solve realworld problems using the most powerful programming language.

Main ideas are
--------------

1. Impossible is possible.
2. Code should be clear and maintainable.
3. Help community by making more opensource projects with good documentation.

Our roadmap
-----------

1. To build a guidelines (or framework) for web development.
2. To fix `Ceramic <https://github.com/ceramic/ceramic>`_ to build desktop apps
   using Electron.
3. Figure out a way how to do the similar for mobile apps, may be by using
   React Native.
