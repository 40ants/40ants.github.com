<h1 class="page-header">Second version of Ultralisp.org is available now!</h1>
 <p> Tagged as <a href="/tag/release/">release</a> </p> <p class="date-posted"> Written on 2019-02-03 </p> <p>I believe, that software should evolve and evolve quickly.
One of the reasons why Common Lisp seems strange to newcomers is its
ecosystem. It takes a long time to add a new library and make it useful
to other common lispers.</p>

<p>Just pretend that you've made a brand new library and want to show it to
the world. Now you have two options.</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
<li><p>Include it into the Quicklisp and probably wait for 1 month before
   announcing the library on the Reddit or StackOverflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the library on the Github and ask everybody to download it and
   put somewhere where ASDF will be able to find it. Not very
   user-friendly, especially if your library has dependencies which
   aren't on the Quicklisp yet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now ask yourself a question, what if you've chosen the first option, and
some user found a critical bug in your library?</p>

<p>The answer is: &quot;Your users will have to wait another month until the next release of the Quicklisp.&quot;</p>

<p>Quicklisp is a perfect distribution for very stable software, but if we want
our ecosystem to grow, we need something that can move faster. That is
why I decided to spend all my free time working on the https://ultralisp.org.</p>

<p>Ultralisp is a Quicklisp compatible distribution, but it has two core features:</p>

<ol>
<li>It let you (and anybody else) to add their libraries from the GitHub in few clicks.</li>
<li>It builds the next version within 5 minutes after a library was added or updated.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are other features as well. Some of them are already implemented,
others only planned and exist as the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ultralisp/ultralisp/issues&gt;).
You can help this project by using it, complaining about it and developing it.</p>

<p>Ultralisp was made not only to be used as a yet another quicklisp
distribution. You can run your own instance of the Ultralisp. It is as
easy as doing <code>docker-compose run app</code>.</p>

<p>If you are a company who uses Common Lisp, then you can set up a
private Ultralisp server inside your infrastructure. However, don't forget to
become a sponsor of the project ;-)</p>

<h1>How to use Ultralisp.org</h1>

<p>Using libraries from Ultralisp is as easy as adding it to the list of
quicklisp distributions. You can do it in the REPL with this command:</p>

<pre><code>(ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.ultralisp.org/"
                      :prompt nil)</code></pre>

<p>However, I recommend you to pin distribution or libraries versions in
every project. The easiest way to do this is to use Qlot. With Qlot
you'll be able to pin version numbers and commit a config into the
repository. This will give you stable builds which don't depend on
future releases of Quicklisp or Ultralisp.</p>

<p>Here is the simplest config for the <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot" >Qlot</a>:</p>

<pre><code>dist ultralisp http://dist.ultralisp.org/
ql :all :latest
ultralisp :all :latest</code></pre>

<p>It says, that if some system is present in the Ultralisp, it will will
have priority over the same system from the Quicklisp.</p>

<p>After running <code>qlot install</code> or <code>qlot update</code>, Qlot will create a
<code>qlfile.lock</code> file with pinned versions of the Quicklisp and
Ultralisp. It will look like that:</p>

<pre><code>("quicklisp" .
 (:class qlot.source.ql:source-ql-all
  :initargs (:distribution "http://beta.quicklisp.org/dist/quicklisp.txt" :%version :latest)
  :version "2019-02-02"))
("ultralisp" .
 (:class qlot.source.ql:source-ql-all
  :initargs (:distribution "http://dist.ultralisp.org/" :%version :latest)
  :version "20190202213040"))</code></pre>

<p>Commit both <code>qlfile</code> and <code>qlfile.lock</code> into you source control
system.</p>

<p>From time to time you'll need to run <code>qlot update</code> to update versions
in the <code>qlfile.lock</code>, and run all your project's tests to ensure that
it still works with newer distributions. If you discover that something
went wrong, you can pin an older version of Ultralisp in the
<code>qlfile</code>, just replace the line:</p>

<pre><code>ultralisp :all :latest</code></pre>

<p>With the line:</p>

<pre><code>ultralisp :all 20190130205039</code></pre>

<p>Or you can pin a single library by adding a line:</p>

<pre><code>ultralisp cl-pgpass 20190202203038</code></pre>

<p>if it stopped to work for you after some changes in recent versions.</p>

<h1>Final words</h1>

<p>We are all responsible for improving tooling around Common Lisp. If
you feel that something can be made better, just do it. I hope
that together we will make Common Lisp more convenient and attractive
for the newcomers.</p>
