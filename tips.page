Here is a collection of small tips for Lisp newcomers.

Wanted to recompile all places where Lisp macro was expanded?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Here is how to do it:

* On a macro name, hit `C-c C-w m <ENTER>` (this calls function `slime-who-macroexpands`).
* Then Emacs will show a buffer with all places where this macro was expanded.
* Now, hit `C-c C-k` to recompile all of them at once!


If using SLY hit `C-c C-w RET` instead.
